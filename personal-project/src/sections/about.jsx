            I started my coding learning journey in 2021. In 2023, I took a leap
            and trained in modern web development at UNC Chapel Hill Coding
            Bootcamp. I quickly absorbed and reinforced new concepts while
            bringing creative ways to solve problems and a positive attitude to
            new challenges.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            I've always had a love for learning and discovering new things. Be
            it learning an instrument, photography, cooking, or computer
            programming. The quest for knowledge is never truly over.
